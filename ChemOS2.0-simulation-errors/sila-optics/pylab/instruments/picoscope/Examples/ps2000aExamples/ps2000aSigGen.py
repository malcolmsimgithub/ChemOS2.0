# PicoScope 2000 (A API) Series Signal Generator Example
# This example demonstrates how to use the PicoScope 2000 Series (ps2000a) driver API functions to set up the signal generator to do the following:
# 
# 1. Output a sine wave 
# 2. Output a square wave 
# 3. Output a sweep of a square wave signal
