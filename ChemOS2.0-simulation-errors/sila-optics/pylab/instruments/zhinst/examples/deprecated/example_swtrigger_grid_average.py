Zurich Instruments LabOne Python API Example

Python API Example for the Software Trigger (ziDAQRecorder) Core Module in Grid
Mode with averaging enabled. This example demonstrates how to obtain averaged
demodulator data when a demodulator's R value is larger than a specified
threshold using an edge trigger in Grid Mode.

The ziDAQRecorder Module implements software triggering which operates
analogously to the types of triggering found in laboratory oscilloscopes. The
ziDAQRecorder Module has a non-blocking (asynchronous) interface, it starts it's
own thread to communicate with the data server.

This example generates a 'beat' in the demodulator signal in order to simulate
'events' in the demodulator data. Signal segments of these events are then
recorded when the rising edge of the demodulator R value exceeds a certain
threshold.

Grid Mode enables interpolation of the triggered data onto the specified columns
of the grid and alignment of (num_rows) multiple triggers into the rows of the
grid. This example demonstrates the averaging functionality of Grid Mode which
is enabled when trigger/0/grid/repetitions is > 1 and trigger/0/grid/operation
is set to average. The SW Trigger Module triggers on different peaks in the
bi-modal beat generated in the demodulator data (check the Plotter in the LabOne
UI to see the original demod data) and the averaging operation averages the
peaks caught by the trigger.

Note: This example requires a feedback cable between Signal Output 1 and Signal
Input 1 and changes the signal output's amplitude in order to create a signal
upon which to trigger.

    """Run the example: Record averaged bursts of demodulator sample data when a
    demodulator's R becomes larger than a specified threshold using ziPython's
    Software Trigger (ziDAQRecorder) Module in Grid Mode. See this Module's
    docstring and inline comments for further explanation.

    Requirements:

      Hardware configuration: Connect signal output 1 to signal input 1 with a
      BNC cable.

    Arguments:

      device_id (str): The ID of the device to run the example with. For
        example, `dev2006` or `uhf-dev2006`.

      num_grids (int, optional): The number of grids to record.

      do_plot (bool, optional): Specify whether to plot the recorded
        data. Default is no plot output.

    Returns:

      sample (list of dict): A list of demodulator samples. Each entry in the
        list is a dict containing a demodulator sample, each sample corresponds
        to a burst of demodulator data from each each trigger.

    Raises:

      RuntimeError: If the device is not "discoverable" from the API.
