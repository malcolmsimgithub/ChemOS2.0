Zurich Instruments LabOne Python API Example

Demonstrate how to obtain demodulator data using ziDAQServer's blocking
(synchronous) poll() command.

This example demonstrates that whilst poll() does indeed block for the specified
recording duration, it will not only return the data during the recording
duration, but also data accumulated since subscribing (before poll was
called). In other words, subscribed data is buffered by the data server and API
(for a limited time) and this buffered data will also be returned by poll().

    """Run the example: Connect to the device specified by device_id and obtain
    demodulator data using ziDAQServer's blocking (synchronous) poll() command.

    Requirements:

      Hardware configuration: Connect signal output 1 to signal input 1 with a
      BNC cable.

    Arguments:

      device_id (str): The ID of the device to run the example with. For
        example, `dev2006` or `uhf-dev2006`.

      amplitude (float, optional): The amplitude to set on the signal output.

      do_plot (bool, optional): Specify whether to plot the polled data. Default
        is no plot output.

    Returns:

      sample (dict of numpy arrays): The demodulator sample dictionary with the
        additional demod R and demod phi fields calculated in the example.

    Raises:

      RuntimeError: If the device is not "discoverable" from the API.
