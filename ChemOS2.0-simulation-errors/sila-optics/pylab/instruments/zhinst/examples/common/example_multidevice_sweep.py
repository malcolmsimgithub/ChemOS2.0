    """
    Run the example: Perform a frequency sweep on two devices and record
    demodulator data using ziPython's ziDAQSweeper module. The devices are first
    synchronized using the MultiDeviceSync Module, then the sweep is executed
    before stopping the synchronization.

    Requirements:

      Hardware configuration:
      The cabling of the instruments must follow the MDS cabling
      pictured in the MDS tab of LabOne.
      Additionally, connect signal output 1 of the first device (master) to
      signal input 1 of both devices using a splitter.

    Arguments:

      device_ids (list): The IDs of the devices to run the example with. For
        example, ["dev3352","dev3562"].

      amplitude (float, optional): The amplitude to set on the signal output.

      do_plot (bool, optional): Specify whether to plot the sweep. Default is no
        plot output.

     synchronize (bool, optional): Specify if multi-device synchronization will
        be started and stopped before and after the sweep

    Returns:

      data (dict): A dictionary with all the data as returend from the sweeper
        module. It contains all the demodulator data dictionaries and some
        metainformation about the sweep.
