Zurich Instruments LabOne Python API Example

Demonstrate how to save and load Zurich Instruments device settings
asynchronously using the ziDeviceSettings class.

Note: This example is intended for experienced users who require a non-blocking
(asynchronous) interface for loading and saving settings. In general, the
utility functions save_settings() and load_settings() are more appropriate; see
`example_save_device_settings_simple`.

    Run the example: Connect to a Zurich Instruments instrument, save the
    instrument's settings to file, toggle the signal output enable and reload
    the settings file.

    Note: This example is intended for experienced users who require a
    non-blocking (asynchronous) interface for loading and saving settings. In
    general, the utility functions save_settings() and load_settings() are more
    appropriate; see `example_save_device_settings_simple'.

    Arguments:

      device_id (str): The ID of the device to run the example with. For
        example, `dev2006` or `uhf-dev2006`.

      setting_file_path (str, optional): Specify the path where to save the
        settings file.


    Returns:

      filename (str) : the name (with path) of the XML file where the settings
         were saved.

    Raises:

      RuntimeError: If the device is not "discoverable" from the API.

    See the "LabOne Programing Manual" for further help, available:
      - On Windows via the Start-Menu:
        Programs -> Zurich Instruments -> Documentation
      - On Linux in the LabOne .tar.gz archive in the "Documentation"
