Zurich Instruments LabOne Python API Example

Python API Example for the Data Acquisition Module. This example demonstrates
how to record data from an instrument continuously (without triggering).

Note: This example does not perform any device configuration. If the streaming
nodes corresponding to the signal_paths are not enabled, no data will be
recorded.

    """
    Run the example: Record data continuously in 0.2 s chunks for 5 seconds
    using the Data Acquisition Module.

    Arguments:

      device_id (str): The ID of the device to run the example with. For
        example, `dev2006` or `uhf-dev2006`.

      do_plot (bool, optional): Specify whether to plot the recorded
        data. Default is no plot output.

      filename (str, optional): If specified, additionally save the data to a
        directory structure/filename specified by filename.

    Returns:

      data (dict): A dictionary whose keys are the subscribed signal paths. Each
        value is a list which contains all the signal bursts for the signal path
        as returned by the Data Acquisition Module's read() function. Note: Do
        not increase TOTAL_DURATION without removing this continuous save.

    Raises:

      RuntimeError: If the device is not "discoverable" from the API.
